# Resumse
## Resume is a mobile version of my resume. It is an Android app built with Kotlin and the Android SDK. It has many features as follows.

## Features
- **Basic Info**: It contains my basic info such as My name, Stack, Payment info, profile picture, about me and my social media contacts. Users can directly contact me through Whatsapp, Phone call, Email, Twitter, Github and LinkedIn right from the app with one click
- **More Details**: On the KnowMeMore screen, users and potential employers can see what I Offer them if employed. My Skills, Experience and Projects are also on display
- **Dark Mode**: Resume supports both light and dark mode depending on the settings of the user's device
- **Responsive**: Resume is responsive and resizes smoothly to meet any orientation and device size 

## Codebase
Resume follows the MVVM architecture recommended by Google. Follows best practices by not hardcoding strings and view sizes. It also utilizes the Material Design Guide for the UI

## UI Design
The design was completely made by me. And as mentioned before, follows the Material Design Guide Style. It adapts to both landscape and portrait orientations. It also fully supports dark mode

## Libraries
No external libraries are used. All libraries used are part of the Android SDK

## Coming Soon: Here are a list of things that  will be added soon
-	Ability to upload my data remotely by connecting the app to a backend
-	Users able to download my CV right from the app
-	Full description of my past projects

## Challenges
There was no major challenge I faced as I was already familiar with building such an app.
